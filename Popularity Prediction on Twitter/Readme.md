# Popularity prediction on Twitter

In this project, we predict future popularity of a hashtage on twitter based on current (and previous) tweet activity for a hashtag.
We extracted and select features by t-test and p-values. Then we fit and analysed linear regression model, logistic regression model 
and gradient boost model on selected features. Finally we propose our own problem formulation based on a variety of meta data in the given twitter dataset, includeing *How to get more "like"*and *Predict the Team that the Author is in Favor of*. And we used linear regression model, randomforest model and Multinomial Bayes classifier to solve the problems.
