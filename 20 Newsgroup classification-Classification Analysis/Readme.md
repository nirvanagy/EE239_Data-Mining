In this project we looked into different methods for classifying textual data. 
Codes included are for feature extraction, feature selection and learning algorithoms implementation.
Different learning algorithms including Linear Support Vector Machines, soft margin SVM, naïve Bayes algorithm ,logistic regression classifier, Naïve Bayes classification and multiclass SVM classification are implemented and analysed.
